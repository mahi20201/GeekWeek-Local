A quantum computer isn't just an exponentially faster computer; it's a whole new computing paradigm. That is to say, it cannot – at least not yet – be used to solve any form of computing problem. I'll go over that in more detail later.
But how does it function? A bit is a single piece of knowledge in traditional computing that can exist in one of two states: one or zero. Quantum computing, on the other hand, is a method of computing that uses quantum mechanics to solve problems
uses quantum bits, or ‘qubits’ which can have two states. This means that they can store much more information than just 1 or 0.
Quantum dominance occurs when a quantum computer accomplishes something that a conventional, binary, classical computer cannot, either because it is much faster or because it solves a problem that a classical computer is incapable of solving
Google recently claimed that it had achieved this type of supremacy, but this fact was refuted by some: in particular IBM which is also intensively investing in quantum computing.  
What can quantum computing do and who is using it?
-Creating convenience
-Taking care of lives
-Saving the world
There’s a lot of buzz around what the quantum world could mean for machine learning. Even though, as I mentioned above, we will need a different type of algorithms for that to work. 
The interdisciplinary field of Quantum artificial intelligence (QAI) is the one that focuses on developing quantum algorithms for AI, including sub-fields like machine learning.
